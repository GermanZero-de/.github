# Welcome to GermanZero

In the Paris Climate Agreement, Germany committed itself to working with the international community on limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees. Scientists agree that this is only possible if our country becomes climate neutral by 2035 at the latest. Yet, politically, Germany is currently on a different course: current climate policy means we are heading for global warming of more than two degrees.
This is why German Zero is working with experts, scientists, and citizens to develop a 1.5- degree legislative package. It is the first and only complete solution to make Germany climate neutral by 2035. Fair. Effective. Measurable.

## The LocalZero Project

LocalZero aims to provide OpenData and OpenSource packages for estimating and analysing local greenhouse gas emissions to provide guidance for local communities on their way of shaping a climate neutral future.
